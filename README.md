# DM Dock

This app was built with my partner in mind. He is a Dungeons and Dragons game master who runs 2 games a week. His biggest gripe with running his games is how may programs he needs to have open at once. It can get confusing to click through all the tabs and they can slow down his laptop. 

I created DM Dock as a solve for these problems. It provides a one stop stop to look up monster stats, store and update player information, and generate random weather patterns. Users are able to save monster data in a favorites list so they can easily access the information when they inevitably need to come back to it. Dm Dock uses JWT Web tokens, allowing each game master to create their own private profiles.
